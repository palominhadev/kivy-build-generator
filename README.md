# Kivy-Build-Generator for Docker

Project created to facilitate app generation using the Kivy Python library.

**The docker hub image already contains all the necessary dependencies to generate the apk. :** https://hub.docker.com/r/palominhahub/kivy-build

* You must have docker installed on your machine: https://docs.docker.com/install/

* The buildozer library is already installed by default.

* The Dockerfile does not contain the Android dependencies installed by default, you need to build and install manually.

## Installation

* Clone this repository and build the image:
```bash
$ docker build -t <your-name>/kivy-build .
```
```bash
$ docker build --no-cache -t <your-name>/kivy-build .
```
## Usage:

* Command to generate buildozer.spec file:
```bash
$ docker container run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/app/ <your-name>/kivy-build python3 -m buildozer init
```

* Start a Android/debug build with:
```bash
$ docker container run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/app/ <your-name>/kivy-build python3 -m buildozer -v android debug
```

* At the end, you should have an APK or AAB file in the bin/ directory.

* Any questions about deploy or how to generate the release with buildozer, check the official documentation: https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
